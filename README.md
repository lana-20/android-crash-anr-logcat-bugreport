## What is the main difference between <code>adb logcat</code> and <code>adb bugreport</code>?

I use both the [<code>adb logcat</code>](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/logcat) and [<code>adb bugreport</code>](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/bug-report) commands to collect diagnostic info from an Android device. However, they serve different purposes and provide different types of info.
- [ ] <code>adb logcat</code> command is used to collect system logs from an Android device. The logs contain messages generated by the Android system and various apps, and they can be useful for troubleshooting and debugging issues. I often use the command to identify patterns or trends that might help me isolate the root cause of a problem. It also allows me to filter the logs by various criteria.
- [ ] <code>adb bugreport</code> command is used to collect a comprehensive set of logs and diagnostic info from an Android device. In addition to system logs, the bug report includes kernel logs, dumpsys output, info about the hardware and software configs, and other info that be useful for troubleshooting and debugging issues. The command is primarily used to provide detailed info about the device and its current state to support development teams.

Overall, the main difference between <code>adb logcat</code> and <code>adb bugreport</code> is the type and amount of info they collect. The <code>adb logcat</code> command is focused on system logs, while the <code>adb bugreport</code> command collects a more comprehensive set of diagnostic info. Depending on my needs and goals, I might use one or both of these commands to collect info from an Android device. Most of the times, <code>logcat</code> suffices for daily testing purposes. The <code>bugreport.zip</code> file is useful, if I need an ANR report but am not a device root user.
